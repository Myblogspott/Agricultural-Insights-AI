   - Revenue Growth Opportunities: One strategy for increasing revenue could be to expand into under-served regions, provided the demand exists. This could be determined through market research. Another strategy could be to launch new, higher-value products or to increase the marketing of existing high-profit products.
  
   - Cost Reduction Strategies: Reducing costs could involve streamlining operations to eliminate inefficiencies, renegotiating supplier contracts, or investing in technologies that reduce the cost of production.

Risks in the agricultural sector can include weather-related events, fluctuating commodity prices, changes in government policies and regulations, and disease outbreaks.
