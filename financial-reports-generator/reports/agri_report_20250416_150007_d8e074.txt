The regional performance varied throughout 2024. Regions with favorable climatic conditions and efficient farming practices reported higher revenues and profit margins. There were also regions that underperformed due to factors such as unfavorable weather conditions, pest outbreaks, and sub-optimal agricultural practices. Detailed regional performance data will be needed to provide a more in-depth analysis.

**3. Product Overview**
The profitability of agricultural products varied significantly in 2024. Products that had higher demand in the market such as organic vegetables and fruits showed higher profitability. On the other hand, products with lower market demand or higher production costs resulted in lower profit margins.
